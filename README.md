My first Description in here...


This is a README.md file.                 
.md is markdown. 

README.md is used to generate the overview/summary you see at the bottom of projects. 

Github has their own flavor of Markdown. 
Order of Preference: 
    If you have two files named README and README.md, 
    the file named README.md is preferred,
    and it will be used to generate github's html summary.
